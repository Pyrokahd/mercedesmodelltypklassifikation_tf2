All "é" in the metadata have been replaced to "e"
All "ß" in the metadata have been replaced to "ss"
All "ä" in the metadata have been replaced to "ae"
All "ö" in the metadata have been replaced to "oe"
All "ü" in the metadata have been replaced to "ue"
All "Ã" replaced with "ss" (this char was used at some places for "ß" for some reason)

They have been removed manualy. The Web Crawler currently doesnt do it.

This is because: despite encoding="utf-8" and ensure_ascii=False (in json.dump or json.dumps)
those character make trouble when trying to load and sometimes when trying save the json (though that usually works).


Also label "W461/463" is changed to "W461-463" to be able to create a folder with that name. (automatically )
